# Conway's Game of Life: Simulating Cellular Automata in Java

## **Project Overview**

Conway’s Game of Life is a well-known **cellular automaton** that simulates the evolution of cells based on a set of simple rules. Our project implements this simulation in **Java**, allowing for custom grid sizes, pattern initialization, and stepwise evolution.

This project is an excellent example of **emergent complexity**, where simple rules lead to fascinating and unpredictable patterns over time.

## **Project Goals**

- Implement Conway’s Game of Life in **Java**
- Simulate cellular evolution using **neighbor-based rules**
- Support **random and preset patterns**
- Store simulation results in a log file
- Enable visualization of cell states at each step

## **How the Game Works**

The game operates on a 2D grid where each cell can be **alive ('L')** or **dead ('D')**. The state of each cell in the next generation depends on its **eight neighbors** based on these rules:

1. **Underpopulation:** A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies.
2. **Survival:** A live cell with two or three live neighbors continues to live.
3. **Overpopulation:** A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies.
4. **Reproduction:** A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive.

## **Project Implementation**

Our Java implementation consists of three main components:

### **Cell Class**

Each cell has a state (Live or Dead) and supports basic state transitions.

```java
public class Cell {
    private char state; // 'D' for Dead, 'L' for Live

    public Cell(char state) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    public void setState(char state) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    public char getState() {
        return state;
    }
}
```

### **Board Class**

The `Board` class handles the grid initialization, random generation, and neighbor calculations.

```java
public class Board {
    private Cell[][] board;
    private int boardSize;

    public Board(int boardSize) {
        this.boardSize = boardSize;
        this.board = new Cell[boardSize][boardSize];
        this.initBoard();
    }

    public void initBoard() {
        for (int i = 0; i < boardSize; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < boardSize; j++) {
                board[i][j] = new Cell('D');
            }
        }
        randomBoard();
    }

    public void randomBoard() {
        Random r = new Random();
        boolean living;
        for (int i = 0; i < boardSize; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < boardSize; j++) {
                living = r.nextBoolean();
                if(living) board[i][j].setState('L');
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### **Game Class**

This class executes the simulation, printing each step to a log file.

```java
public class Game {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {
        PrintStream fileOutput = new PrintStream(new File("output.txt"));
        System.setOut(fileOutput);

        Board board = new Board(20);
        for (int iteration = 0; iteration < 100; iteration++) {
            board.run(iteration);
        }
    }
}
```

## **Features & Enhancements**

* **Randomized Initial State** – Each run generates a different board configuration.
* **Predefined Patterns** – Implements structures like **Blinkers** and **Gliders**.
* **File Logging** – Saves simulation results to a text file for analysis.
* **Configurable Board Size** – Allows customization of grid dimensions.

## **Future Improvements**

* **Graphical Visualization** – Implementing a GUI using JavaFX or Swing.
* **Custom Pattern Input** – Users can define their own starting patterns.
* **Optimized Performance** – Using multithreading for faster simulations.

## **Final Thoughts**

Conway’s Game of Life is an excellent demonstration of how **simple rules** can create **complex behaviors**. This project not only deepens our understanding of **cellular automata** but also strengthens Java programming skills in **object-oriented design** and **algorithmic problem-solving**.
