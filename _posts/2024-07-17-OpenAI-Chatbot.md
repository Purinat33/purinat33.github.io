# OpenAI Chatbot using RAG

## What is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

When, instead of supplying only the prompt to an LLM, which can lead to what is called **Hallucination**, we also give an LLM a relevant context to take answers from.

## Project

In the project, using an AI Generated short story to make the project small, using an OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo, we are able to integrate it with other RAG related libraries to create a simple RAG pipeline for querying about our story with minimal hallucination.
