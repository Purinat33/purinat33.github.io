# Building a RAG-Based LLM Application: An AI Project  

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an exciting AI technique that enhances large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant information from external sources. My team and I have been working on a **RAG-powered AI assistant** that integrates **OpenAI’s LLM**, **LangChain**, and **FAISS** to improve response accuracy and context-awareness.  

## 🔍 **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on **retrieving relevant information** from documents before passing it to an LLM, allowing for more fact-based and context-aware responses.  

### **Key Features**  
✅ **Loads and Processes a .txt File** – Works with one document at a time for now.  
✅ **Chunking and Splitting** – Breaks long texts into smaller parts for efficient retrieval.  
✅ **Embedding and Storage** – Uses **sentence-transformers** for vector embeddings and **FAISS** for fast similarity search.  
✅ **Custom Prompting & LLM Integration** – Uses a **custom teacher-like persona** to answer queries based on retrieved content.  
✅ **Efficient Retrieval** – Finds the most relevant document chunks using **vector search**.  

## ⚙️ **How It Works**  
1. **Load Document** – The application downloads or loads a `.txt` file and preprocesses it.  
2. **Chunking & Embedding** – The text is split into meaningful sections, which are converted into vector representations.  
3. **Vector Store (FAISS)** – The embeddings are stored for fast retrieval.  
4. **Querying** – The user inputs a question, and the system searches for the most relevant chunks.  
5. **RAG Processing** – The retrieved text is fed into OpenAI’s LLM for generating fact-based responses.  

## 🚀 **Current Progress**  
🔹 Successfully implemented document loading, chunking, and embedding.  
🔹 FAISS-based retrieval is working well for finding relevant text.  
🔹 Initial tests with OpenAI’s LLM show promising responses.  

## 🔮 **Future Enhancements**  
🔜 **Multi-Document Support** – Expanding the system to handle multiple sources.  
🔜 **Chatbot Integration** – Creating an interactive interface for dynamic Q&A.  
🔜 **Streamlit Web UI** – Adding a user-friendly frontend for accessibility.  
🔜 **Improved Embeddings & Retrieval** – Experimenting with different embeddings for better accuracy.  

## 📌 **Why This Matters?**  
🔹 **Improves LLM Accuracy** – Reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in real data.  
🔹 **Practical AI Application** – Useful for chatbots, knowledge bases, and research assistants.  
🔹 **Enhances Information Retrieval** – Provides structured responses rather than generic text generation.  

This project has been a great deep dive into **RAG, vector search, and AI-driven knowledge retrieval**.
