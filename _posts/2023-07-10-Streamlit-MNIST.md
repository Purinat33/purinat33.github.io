# Creating a Handwriting Recognition Software using Deep Learning on a Web-Based Platform

[Link to Web Application](https://mnist-playground.streamlit.app/)

## What is Streamlit

Streamlit is a Python library designed for fast and easy interactive web applications deployment, all for free.

## Handwritten Digit Classification

The MNIST database for handwritten digit classification is considered by most to be an excellent introduction to the topic of deep learning and neural network.

## Purpose

The purpose of this web application is to allow for a convenient access to a simple handwritten digit classification application without the need to install complex libraries for a user to run on a given machine.

Additionally, an "Upload Your Digit" feature allows the user to upload an image of their own drawing outside of the pre-existing MNIST image files.
