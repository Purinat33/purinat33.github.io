## Who I am

I’m Purinat Pattanakeaw. I build software and use projects to learn.

## What I work on

- Full-stack apps (APIs, databases, UI)
- Data / ML projects (from analysis to deployment)
- Security-related tools and experiments

## What you’ll see on this site

Most posts include the goal, approach, key decisions, results, and what I’d improve next. I keep the writing practical and focused on what I actually built.
